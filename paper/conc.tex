\section{Conclusion}
    \label{sec:conc}
We have developed a music sharing application called ClouDJ.
ClouDJ allows multiple clients to listen to music together. A host
can choose songs to play that other clients can listen to in
realtime. ClouDJ uses a JavaScript-based client and a Google App Engine
backed server. Through our design and implementation, ClouDJ
is able to achieve good performance with many active sessions
or listeners. It also has high availability through the use of Datastore and
Blobstore for session and song storage as well as a multiple-handler based server.
Furthermore, ClouDJ achieves good scalability as more clients are added to the system,
shown in our evaluation section.
