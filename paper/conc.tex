\section{Conclusion}
    \label{sec:conc}
We have developed a music sharing application called ClouDJ.
ClouDJ allows multiple clients to listen to music together. A host can start
a music session that other clients can join and listen to in
realtime. ClouDJ uses a JavaScript-based client and a Google App Engine
backed server. Through our design and implementation, ClouDJ
is able to achieve our design goals of good performance, availability, and scalability.
ClouDJ achieves good performance with many active sessions
or listeners, supported by our evaluation results. It does so by using efficient synchronization between clients.
ClouDJ also achieves high availability of music sessions through the use of Google App Engine
services for sessions and songs. Additionally, it tolerates many
component-based failures such as disconnected listeners or a master server failure.
Finally, ClouDJ achieves good playback scalability as more clients are added to the system,
shown in our evaluation section. It does so by using the highly concurrent and scalable infrastructure
of Google App Engine.
