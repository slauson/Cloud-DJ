\section{Conclusion}
    \label{sec:conc}
We have developed a music sharing application called ClouDJ.
ClouDJ allows multiple clients to listen to music together.
It uses a JavaScript-based client and a Google App Engine
backed server. Through our design and implementation, ClouDJ
is able to achieve good performance with many active sessions
or listeners, good availability as components fail, and
good scalability as more clients are added to the system.
