\section{Conclusion}
    \label{sec:conc}
We will be developing a music sharing application 
called ClouDJ. With ClouDJ, users will be able to 
host music sessions that other users can listen to 
in real-time. It will consist of many client users 
as well as some centralized servers to handle 
session and user state. We will make use of Google 
App Engine for the implementation of the system.
