\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
We will evaluate our system on the metrics of performance, 
availability and scalibilty. To measure performance, 
we will design benchmarks to measure the data rate 
of a listener versus the data rate of the host. To 
evaluate availability, we will examine how our system 
behaves with various failure modes by artificially 
taking down each role (client, master server, session 
server). For scalability, we will measure system 
performance as we add clients to the system. We can 
achieve this by launching our application on an 
increasing number of client machines.
