\begin{abstract}
While there are plenty of distributed music streaming applications, there is a surprisingly 
limited selection of standalone services for listening to music with others online. 
Thus, we present the design and implementation of ClouDJ, a distributed application 
that enables multiple users to listen to songs at the same time in a shared session.
ClouDJ was designed with the goals of performance, availability, and scalability
in mind. This is achieved through synchronization, use of Google App Engine 
services, and concurrency.
