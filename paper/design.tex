\section{Design}
\label{sec:design}
To create ClouDJ, we will implement the design described 
in subsections \ref{sec:frontend} and \ref{sec:roles} 
by integrating Google App Engine. 
Figure \ref{fig:arch} depicts the overall system and how each element 
interacts during a normal session. If we have enough time, 
we will consider multi-host sessions, dynamic access 
control lists, and adding remote files to session playlists.

\caption{Depiction of typical message flow for one music session. 
1) Host client sends a message to the master server telling it to create a session. 
2) The master server chooses a session server to serve the session and 
sends it a create session message. 
3) The chosen session server sends a message back to the 
host client to establish the connection. 
4) The host then sends data received from the host client to client listeners.

\subsection{Front End}
\label{sec:frontend}
A session is an abstraction in which multiple users 
may listen to one song that is hosted by a single user. 
Our front end application will allow a user to either 
create a session and become a host, or join an existing 
session and become a listener. When acting as a host, 
a user may add or remove songs from the session playlist, 
select the currently playing song, and play/pause the 
current song. When acting as a listener, the user has 
no control over what song is being played. Users can 
see all sessions that they are able to join. Only 
members of a user's access control list (ACL) may 
see or join any session in which that user is a host.

\subsection{Roles}
\label{sec:roles}
There are three major roles in our system: 
the master server, session server, and client. Clients own 
and store music, can share their music with others 
and can listen to music shared by others. There is a 
single master server that provides access control, 
starts sessions for users who want to host and provides 
minimally acts as a liaison between the clients and 
session servers. Session servers' main functionality 
is streaming music from host-client to listener-clients.

\subsection{Back End}
\label{sec:backend}
The backend infrastructure is more complicated than 
the frontend. The master server keeps track of users 
currently online, user ACLs, and user membership lists 
(ACLs it is a member of). It also is responsible for 
maintaining a session table, a table that maps host 
users to the session servers (this is a one-to-one mapping). 
When a client logs on, the master server informs each 
session server associated to a host on the client's 
membership list that this client is a potential listener.

The session server is the workhorse of the system. It 
services requests for sessions it is in charge of by 
routing data from the host client to relevant clients 
(listeners). It maintains the list of listeners and 
potential listeners. A potential listener is a client 
who could listen to this session, but is currently not. 
In other words, these are the clients on the host client's 
ACL that are logged in but not listening to this 
session. Session servers also take care of session 
cleanup when a session ends (or fails). 

Finally, the client exists on the user machine 
has access to its user's music and playlists and 
also keeps track of data such as the user's current 
session and the user's potential sessions (sessions 
this user can access). For the current session, the 
client keeps it's session server address and stream. 
For the potential sessions, the client keeps the host, 
session server address, and currently playing song.

Sessions are created when a client contacts the master 
server about hosting a new session. The master server 
then contacts a session server to create a new session. 
On success, the session server contacts the client, 
which updates its current session information. 
Clients may join sessions by contacting the session 
server, at which point, data from the host will be 
sent to the session server, which will forward the 
stream to any listeners. Notice that after a session 
is established, the client no longer communicates 
with the master server and the master server handles 
no client data, only client meta-data.
