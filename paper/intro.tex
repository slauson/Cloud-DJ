\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
For our project we designed and implemented ClouDJ, 
a music sharing application that uses a centralized 
server system. The ClouDJ application allows multiple 
clients to simultaneously listen to music together 
in shared sessions. This is similar to Google Hangouts 
\cite{googlehangouts} and Spotify \cite{spotify}
You can see our application online \cite{ourapp} as well as our source 
code \cite{ourcode}.
We designed a system with the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Performance: users that are participating in 
    a session together should be able to listen to music at a similar rate.
  \item Availability: users must be able to continuously 
    listen to music in a session assuming the user hosting 
    the session is available.
  \item Scalability: adding clients should not affect system performance.
\end{itemize}
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:design}
we discuss the architecture and design of the underlying components. 
In Section~\ref{sec:implementation} we examine the implementation details
and how we adapt the design to the Google App Engine framework. In 
Section~\ref{sec:eval} we evaluate our system based on the aforementioned
performance goals, and in Section~\ref{sec:futurework} and Section~\ref{sec:conc}
we finish with future work and concluding remarks.
