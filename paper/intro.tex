For our project we will design and implement ClouDJ, 
a music sharing application that uses a centralized 
server system. The ClouDJ application allows multiple 
clients to simultaneously listen to music together 
in shared sessions. To this end, we designed a system 
with the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Performance: users that are participating in 
    a session together should be able to listen to music at a similar rate.
  \item Availability: users must be able to continuously 
    listen to music in a session assuming the user hosting 
    the session is available.
  \item Scalability: adding clients should not affect system performance.
\end{itemize}
